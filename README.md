# MBTI_DatingApp
This was made as part of a group project for the Human Computer Interaction module. While I do not have direct access to the code, this is the documentation for the application. MBTI (Myers-Briggs Type Indicator) is a questionnaire that indicates individuals psychological preferences in how they make decisions and see the world. Squid is a dating application we designed to use MBTI to match people. The majority of this document was contributed to by myself, where I and another team member designed and implemented the application, while the final member conducted usibility testing to evaluate the products demand.
